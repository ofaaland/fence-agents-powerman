# fence-agents-powerman

fence-agents-powerman provides a fence agent for use with pacemaker,
which uses powerman to control and monitor the power status of
hosts.

This fence agent requires powerman, pacemaker, and the fence-agents-common
packages to function.

This is just a packaged version of the new fence agent.  The tree for
the fence agents is at:
